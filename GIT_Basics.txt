			|||GIT and GIT HUB Basics||


Here will be described how to set up and use GIT and GIT HUB.

[[INITIATE]]
First we navigate to folder where is the code Files we wanna tracken. [whit cd <Folder name]>.

We type there 

	git init

To initiate version corntrol in the folder hidden Folde '.git is created' .

We are telling who makes changes whit mail and username

	git config --global user.email 'mail'
	git config --global user.name  'username'

In GIT   we have three stages 
	
	>local area

	>staging area
		
	>commited

To add file to >staging area we are using command

	git add <file name>

	/if we want to add all files from the folder we use/
	
	git add .

If we want to remove the file from >staging area we use the command:

	git rm --cached <file name >

After file is change and we want to commit (to safe the change to 'Time line') we use:

	git commit -m "msg, remark"

[[BRRANCHES]]

Variation of the code 'offbranching' 
Creating new Branch whit command:

	git checkout -b <branch name>

Now new branch is created

We navigate between Branhes whit:

	git checkout <branch name[where we wanna go]>

To see which Branches we have we use:

	git branch

		>we can see in which Branch we are  at moment so that 
		 in front of the Branch is a *
			main
		       *master [we are in master Branch]
			code 

[[MERGE]]

We can merge two Branches together whit command 

	git merge <name of the Branch where from we want to import chages>

Oftentimes we can see 'merge conflict' if two files whit the same name have diffrent content inside.

[[REMOTE REPOSITORY]]

We can rename Branch whit:
	
	git branch -M <new Branch name>

To ad Branch for remote repo.

	git remote origin <URL>
		    ||
                    \/
             |new Branch name 'origin' is most common|

	git push -u origin main
        	      |     | 
            	    Where  From which Branch we push


To update changes from remote Repo in Local Repo.

	git pull
